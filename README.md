# Patient-History-Dashboard

Developed a comprehensive Patient History Dashboard in Power BI to track and analyze patient waiting lists for Inpatient and Outpatient services in healthcare settings.

Collection and transformation of data from various sources, ensuring accuracy and relevance through a high-level data study assessing data quality and metrics.

Cleaned and structured data using Power Query Editor by renaming columns, rearranging data, and appending tables for improved data organization.

Built relationships between tables to enhance data retrieval and streamline reporting capabilities.

Created dynamic DAX measures, including "Latest Month Wait List" and "PY Latest Month Wait List," for real-time calculations.

Improved data visibility and accessibility, resulting in a more efficient patient management system.

The Zip File contains the the dataset of the dashboard.
